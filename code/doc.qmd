# Problem 1. Personal Data

## a.

I could calculate the amount of sleep (hours) I get in a day and compare the results by grouping days by the main mode of transportation I used: bike, bus, or walking. I expect that I will get more hours of sleep on days when I walk and get more steps since I will be more tired after a day of walking. I would also expect that I sleep less on days where I take the bus since I would be less tired.

## b.

```{r}

ggplot(data = my_data_clean, 
       aes(x = transportation_mode, # x-axis
           y = sleep_hrs, # y-axis
           color = transportation_mode)) + # fill geoms by transportation mode
  
  geom_boxplot(color = "darkgrey") + # create boxplots
  
  geom_jitter(height = 0, # create jitter points and adjust their size, width, and opacity
              width = 0.1,
              size = 2,
              alpha = 0.6) + # data points set to 60% opacity
  
  scale_color_manual(values = c("firebrick4", "orange", "forestgreen")) + # set custom colors
  
  theme_minimal() + # minimal theme
  labs(title = str_wrap("Boxplot comparing hours of sleep versus mode of transportation used in a day", width = 60), #wrap title so it doesn't get cut off
       x = "Mode of transportation", # title x axis
       y = "Hours slept") + # title y axis
  
  theme(legend.position = "none") + # take out the legend
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) # center the title

```

## c.

caption: jittered box plots comparing number of hours slept based on the mode of transportation used in a day (bike, bus, or walking). Each box summarizes the distribution of sleep hours for each transportation mode. The individual data points representing teh amount of hours slept in one day are jittered and offset to improve visibility.

## d. 

```{r}

summary_table <- my_data_clean %>% # use my_data_clean
  group_by(transportation_mode) %>% # group by transportation mode
  rename("Mode of Transportation" = transportation_mode) %>% # rename column 1
  summarise( # summarize data
    Q1 = round(quantile(sleep_hrs, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE), 1), #calculate 1st quartile
    Median = round(median(sleep_hrs, na.rm = TRUE), 1), # calculate median
    Q3 = round(quantile(sleep_hrs, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE),1), # calculate third quartile
    Min = round(min(sleep_hrs, na.rm = TRUE), 1), # calculate minimum value
    Max = round(max(sleep_hrs, na.rm = TRUE), 1) # calculate maximum value
  )

summary_table %>% # create a summary table
  gt() %>% # use gt
  cols_align(
    align = "center", # center info in the columns
    columns = c(Q1, Median, Q3, Min, Max) # center all columns but the first column
  ) %>%
  tab_header( 
    title = "Summary of Sleep Hours by Transportation Mode" # create a title
  )

# Problem 3. Statistical Critique

## a.

In the article titled "Pollination features and floral volatiles of *Gymnospermium scipetarum* (Berberidaceae)," the authors investigate the co-evolution between angiosperms and pollinators and wonder just how dependent flowering plants have become on these insects. To answer this question, the authors recorded the amount of seeds produced by *Gymnospermium scipetarum* racemes following a pollinators exclusion experiment where the flowers are capped to prevent contact with pollinators. They used a control test where a raceme was left uncapped to compare the results of the pollinator exclusion experiment using a Mann_Whitney U test to determine whether the difference in seed set is significant or not. The authors visualize their results with the box plot below comparing the median and spread from of the "capped" and "uncapped' results.

## b.

The authors clearly articulated the general results of their experiments using the box plots which help communicate the median, range and quartiles of the data which is appropriate for running a Mann-Whitney U test. The x and y axis are also appropriately named and clearly explain that experiment counted the amount of seeds produced in two separate groups: a capped group and a control group. However, the graph fails to show the mean, standard errors, individual data points and outliers, or model predictions which limits our view of the underlying data; instead the mean and standard deviations are communicated in the paragraph above.

## c.

The authors eliminated any "visual clutter" by opting for a simple and effective box and whisker plot which entirely removes any individual data points. I would say that the figure also has a high data:ink ratio where nearly all visual elements contribute to communicating data.

## d.

For this box plot, I would recommend some more interesting colors for the actual box plots to invite the viewer and make it more visually appealing. I would also include some outliers to the box plots for a more detailed data spread representation. Personally, I also like when the grid lines are visible, even if faint, to make it easier to connect the box plot data to the y axis. The graph is also missing a title which is necessary to quickly refer to each table and provide a brief summary of the graph contents.
