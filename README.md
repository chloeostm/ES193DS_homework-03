# ES193DS_homework-03

This is my repository for my homework 3 assignment :)
In this assignment I wrangled personal data, created and affective visaualiztaion, and provided a statistical critique of a reserach article. 

The 1st portion involving my personal data refers to the data I have been collecting, specifically on the hours of sleep i get in a day and the mode of transportation I used that day.
To visualize the data results, I used:
- a jittered box plot graph to represent the underlying data when comparing sleep in hours by mode of transporttation in a day
- a summary table sharing the median, quartiles, minimum, and maximum calculated using the data
